<h1><span class="sp1">NAVY DAY</span></h1>

<h2>By Harry Harrison</h2>

<div class="hd1">Illustrated by Kelly Freas</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">General Wingrove</span>
looked at the rows of faces
without seeing them. His vision
went beyond the Congress of the
United States, past the balmy June
day to another day that was coming.
A day when the Army would
have its destined place of authority.</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath and delivered
what was perhaps the
shortest speech ever heard in the
hallowed halls of Congress:</p>

<p>"The General Staff of the U.S.
Army requests Congress to abolish
the archaic branch of the armed
forces known as the U.S. Navy."</p>

<p>The aging Senator from
Georgia checked his hearing aid to
see if it was in operating order,
while the press box emptied itself
in one concerted rush and a clatter
of running feet that died off in
the direction of the telephone
room. A buzz of excited comment
ran through the giant chamber.
One by one the heads turned to
face the Naval section where rows
of blue figures stirred and buzzed
like smoked-out bees. The knot of
men around a paunchy figure heavy
with gold braid broke up and Admiral
Fitzjames climbed slowly to
his feet.</p>

<p>Lesser men have quailed before
that piercing stare, but General
Wingrove was never the lesser man.
The admiral tossed his head with
disgust, every line of his body denoting
outraged dignity. He turned
to his audience, a small pulse beating
in his forehead.</p>

<p>"I cannot comprehend the general's
attitude, nor can I understand
why he has attacked the Navy
in this unwarranted fashion. The
Navy has existed and will always
exist as the first barrier of American
defense. I ask you, gentlemen,
to ignore this request as you would
ignore the statements of any person ... er,
slightly demented. I
should like to offer a recommendation
that the general's sanity be investigated,
and an inquiry be made
as to the mental health of anyone
else connected with this preposterous
proposal!"</p>

<p>The general smiled calmly. "I
understand, Admiral, and really
don't blame you for being slightly
annoyed. But, please let us not bring
this issue of national importance
down to a shallow personal level.
The Army has facts to back up this
request&mdash;facts that shall be demonstrated
tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>Turning his back on the raging
admiral, General Wingrove included
all the assembled solons in
one sweeping gesture.</p>

<p>"Reserve your judgment until
that time, gentlemen, make no hasty
judgments until you have seen the
force of argument with which we
back up our request. It is the end
of an era. In the morning the Navy
joins its fellow fossils, the dodo and
the brontosaurus."</p>

<p>The admiral's blood pressure
mounted to a new record and the
gentle thud of his unconscious body
striking the floor was the only sound
to break the shocked silence of the
giant hall.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The early</span> morning sun
warmed the white marble of the
Jefferson Memorial and glinted
from the soldiers' helmets and the
roofs of the packed cars that
crowded forward in a slow-moving
stream. All the gentlemen of Congress
were there, the passage of
their cars cleared by the screaming
sirens of motorcycle policemen.
Around and under the wheels of the
official cars pressed a solid wave of
government workers and common
citizens of the capital city. The
trucks of the radio and television
services pressed close, microphones
and cameras extended.</p>

<p>The stage was set for a great day.
Neat rows of olive drab vehicles
curved along the water's edge. Jeeps
and half-tracks shouldered close by
weapons carriers and six-bys, all of
them shrinking to insignificance beside
the looming Patton tanks. A
speakers' platform was set up in the
center of the line, near the audience.</p>

<p>At precisely 10 a.m., General Wingrove
stepped forward and scowled
at the crowd until they settled into
an uncomfortable silence. His
speech was short and consisted of
nothing more than amplifications
of his opening statement that actions
speak louder than words. He
pointed to the first truck in line, a
2&frac12;-ton filled with an infantry
squad sitting stiffly at attention.</p>

<p>The driver caught the signal and
kicked the engine into life; with
a grind of gears it moved forward
toward the river's edge. There was
an indrawn gasp from the crowd
as the front wheels ground over the
marble parapet&mdash;then the truck was
plunging down toward the muddy
waters of the Potomac.</p>

<p>The wheels touched the water
and the surface seemed to sink
while taking on a strange glassy
character. The truck roared into
high gear and rode forward on the
surface of the water surrounded
by a saucer-shaped depression. It
parked two hundred yards off shore
and the soldiers, goaded by the
sergeant's bark, leapt out and lined
up with a showy <i>present arms</i>.</p>

<p>The general returned the salute
and waved to the remaining vehicles.
They moved forward in a
series of maneuvers that indicated
a great number of rehearsal hours
on some hidden pond. The tanks
rumbled slowly over the water
while the jeeps cut back and forth
through their lines in intricate patterns.
The trucks backed and
turned like puffing ballerinas.</p>

<p>The audience was rooted in a
hushed silence, their eyeballs bulging.
They continued to watch the
amazing display as General Wingrove
spoke again:</p>

<p>"You see before you a typical
example of Army ingenuity, developed
in Army laboratories. These
motor units are supported on the
surface of the water by an intensifying
of the surface tension in
their immediate area. Their weight
is evenly distributed over the surface,
causing the shallow depressions
you see around them.</p>

<p>"This remarkable feat has been
accomplished by the use of the
<i>Dornifier</i>. A remarkable invention
that is named after that brilliant
scientist, Colonel Robert A. Dorn,
Commander of the Brooke Point
Experimental Laboratory. It was
there that one of the civilian employees
discovered the Dorn effect&mdash;under
the Colonel's constant guidance,
of course.</p>

<p>"Utilizing this invention the
Army now becomes master of the
sea as well as the land. Army convoys
of trucks and tanks can blanket
the world. The surface of the
water is our highway, our motor
park, our battleground&mdash;the airfield
and runway for our planes."</p>

<p>Mechanics were pushing a Shooting
Star onto the water. They
stepped clear as flame gushed from
the tail pipe; with the familiar
whooshing rumble it sped down the
Potomac and hurled itself into the
air.</p>

<p>"When this cheap and simple
method of crossing oceans is
adopted, it will of course mean the
end of that fantastic medieval
anachronism, the Navy. No need
for billion-dollar aircraft carriers,
battleships, drydocks and all the
other cumbersome junk that keeps
those boats and things afloat. Give
the taxpayer back his hard-earned
dollar!"</p>

<p>Teeth grated in the Naval section
as carriers and battleships were
called "boats" and the rest of
America's sea might lumped under
the casual heading of "things." Lips
were curled at the transparent appeal
to the taxpayer's pocketbook.
But with leaden hearts they knew
that all this justified wrath and contempt
would avail them nothing.
This was Army Day with a vengeance,
and the doom of the Navy
seemed inescapable.</p>

<p>The Army had made elaborate
plans for what they called "Operation
Sinker." Even as the general
spoke the publicity mills ground
into high gear. From coast to coast
the citizens absorbed the news with
their morning nourishment.</p>

<p>"... Agnes, you hear what the
radio said! The Army's gonna give
a trip around the world in a B-36
as first prize in this limerick contest.
All you have to do is fill in the
last line, and mail one copy to
the Pentagon and the other to the
Navy ..."</p>

<p>The Naval mail room had standing
orders to burn all the limericks
when they came in, but some of the
newer men seemed to think the
entire thing was a big joke. Commander
Bullman found one in the
mess hall:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">The Army will always be there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the land, on the sea, in the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So why should the Navy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take all of the gravy ...<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="noin">to which a seagoing scribe had
added:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">And not give us ensigns our share?<br /></span>
</div>

<p>The newspapers were filled daily
with photographs of mighty B-36's
landing on Lake Erie, and grinning
soldiers making mock beachhead
attacks on Coney Island. Each man
wore a buzzing black box at his
waist and walked on the bosom of
the now quiet Atlantic like a biblical
prophet.</p>

<p>Radio and television also carried
the thousands of news releases that
poured in an unending flow from
the Pentagon Building. Cards, letters,
telegrams and packages descended
on Washington in an overwhelming
torrent. The Navy Department
was the unhappy recipient
of deprecatory letters and a vast
quantity of little cardboard battleships.</p>

<p>The people spoke and their representatives
listened closely. This
was an election year. There didn't
seem to be much doubt as to the
decision, particularly when the reduction
in the budget was considered.</p>

<p>It took Congress only two months
to make up its collective mind. The
people were all pro-Army. The novelty
of the idea had fired their
imaginations.</p>

<p>They were about to take the final
vote in the lower house. If the
amendment passed it would go to
the states for ratification, and their
votes were certain to follow that of
Congress. The Navy had fought a
last-ditch battle to no avail. The
balloting was going to be pretty
much of a sure thing&mdash;the wet
water Navy would soon become ancient
history.</p>

<p>For some reason the admirals
didn't look as unhappy as they
should.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The Naval</span> Department had
requested one last opportunity to
address the Congress. Congress had
patronizingly granted permission,
for even the doomed man is allowed
one last speech. Admiral Fitzjames,
who had recovered from his choleric
attack, was the appointed
speaker.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the Congress of
the United States. We in the Navy
have a fighting tradition. We 'damn
the torpedoes' and sail straight
ahead into the enemy's fire if that
is necessary. We have been stabbed
in the back&mdash;we have suffered a
second Pearl Harbor sneak attack!
The Army relinquished its rights
to fair treatment with this attack.
Therefore we are <i>counter-attacking</i>!"
Worn out by his attacking
and mixed metaphors, the Admiral
mopped his brow.</p>

<p>"Our laboratories have been
working night and day on the perfection
of a device we hoped we
would never be forced to use. It
is now in operation, having passed
the final trials a few days ago.</p>

<p>"The significance of this device
<i>cannot</i> be underestimated. We are
so positive of its importance that&mdash;we
are <i>demanding</i> that the <i>Army</i>
be abolished!"</p>

<p>He waved his hand toward the
window and bellowed one word.</p>

<p>"LOOK!"</p>

<p>Everyone looked. They blinked
and looked again. They rubbed
their eyes and kept looking.</p>

<p>Sailing majestically up the middle
of Constitution Avenue was the
battleship Missouri.</p>

<p>The Admiral's voice rang
through the room like a trumpet of
victory.</p>

<p>"The Mark-1 Debinder, as you
see, temporarily lessens the binding
energies that hold molecules of solid
matter together. Solids become liquids,
and a ship equipped with
this device can sail anywhere in the
world&mdash;on sea <i>or</i> land. Take your
vote, gentlemen; the world awaits
your decision."</p>
